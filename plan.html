        <h1>The Minds Behind 9/11</h1>
        <p class="bold">Al Qaeda, the minds behind the horrific attack of 9/11. The terroists that claimed the lives of many people and 
          even celebrated after they did that. But you might be thinking, why? Why would Al Qaeda do this, was it to get back at the U.S.A, is it because they despised
          our freedom or maybe some ulterior motive came to play. To find out who and why? Al Qaeda would relentlessly murder thousands of Americans you need to know aobut its origins and its founder.

        <h1>Osama Bin Laden (founder)</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
          On September 11th, 2001 4 planes left their respective airports, little did the passengers and pilots know, terrorists from a group called al Qaeda were going to hijack the plane and commit the worst acts of terrorism in the United States of America. But that brings up a serious and important question. Why did al Qaeda and its founder commit those acts? <br> <br>   
On March 10, 1957 (or 1958) Osama bin Laden was born in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, he never really knew his dad quite well, as his mom, Alia Ghanem divorced his dad when he was just 3 years old. His dad, Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden was a multi-millionaire businessman, he had around 50 children and 20 wives, he also had a strict moral code and treated his sons harshly as if they were adults. He died when Osama bin Laden was 10 years old. Growing up, Osama bin Laden’s mom stated that “he was a very good kid and he loved me very much.” Thus brings up a question when did he get such extreme and radical ideas? <br> <br> 
In a shocking and heinous interview on Alia Ghanem (Osama bin Laden’s mom), it is found out that Osama bin Laden most likely got his questionable ideas from outsiders and his mentor Abdullah Azzam. Osama bin Laden’s mom quotes that he was “brainwashed” by his mentor. The ideology he followed was called jihadism. The man credited for spreading jihadism around the world was called Sayyid Qutb, an Egyptian thinker. Sayyid Qutb traveled to the United States in 1948 to study, and what he found there appalled him. He became repulsed by modern “American” culture. What he wanted more than anything was for Muhmmad and Muslim armies to control most of the world. He told his followers that “Muslims must take up arms against the non-believers.” Later, this quote would be used by al Qaeda to condone mass-murder to outsiders and their own people. Sayyid Qutb might not have known it back then, but his ideology started to create groups around the world to start to commit horrific acts of terrorism. <br> <br>Later in his life, he would continue to make numerous threats to America and to its new president Barack Obama and finally, in a heartfelt and dramatic night of May 2nd, 2011, Barack Obama reported that CIA operatives had located and ended his life. Though Osama bin Laden committed numerous awful acts of terrorism, he was also brainwashed by his mentor, and it seems like his mother may have been telling the truth when she said “he was a very good kid and he loved me very much.” It also shows that people can be manipulated and though his actions were awful, it shows that history isn’t so black and white.

          Al Qaeda is a Militant Islamist Organization founded by Osama bin Laden, his mentor Abdullah Azzam and Ayman al-Zawahiri Osama bin Laden’s eventual right-hand man. Its original goal was to help Muslims fight the Soviet Union in the “Holy War.” But once the Soviet Union got pushed back out of Afghanistan the organization dissolved, though they still remained active commenting on other leaders that they thought was nefarious. Meanwhile Abdullah Azzam wanted the whole of Afghanistan to convert to an Islamist government when suddenly he was assassinated by a car bombing incident in Pakistan. This left Osama bin Laden as its leader.
<br> <br>
After that, somewhere in the 1990s, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. The United States of America sent troops to Saudi Arabia to defend against Saddam Hussein, but this turned out to be an atrocious idea because it made Osama bin Laden and other people from Saudi Arabia resentful of the USA. Why? It was because they sent Christian troops from another nation to Saudi Arabia, home to Islam’s 2 holiest and cherished religious sites, Mecca and Medina. In fact, this enraged Osama bin Laden so much, that when interviewed of why he committed the crimes of 9/11, he told the reporter that this moment was a major motivation for him to commit the crimes.
Over the years Osama bin Laden and his right-hand man Ayman al-Zawahiri would commit many vicious and vile crimes on America even before the attack of 9/11, like attacking two important helicopters in the Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia in 1993, the World Trade Center Bombing in New York in 1993, a car bombing in 1995 which annihilated an American military building in Saudi Arabia, they also attacked American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and in 2000 they attacked the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen with suicide bombings, which resulted in 17 American sailors killed and 39 injured. Later, after being exiled from Saudi reign, deprived of his citizenship in 1984, and removed from Sudan in 1986, the organization finally got its headquarters in Afghanistan by the aid of the Taliban militia. Finally, Osama bin Laden in 1986 and 1989 declared war on America and committed the worst act of terrorism in the history of America... 9/11 on September 11th 2001.
