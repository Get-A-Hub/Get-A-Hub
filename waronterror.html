          <h1>The War on Terror & What We Do Today</h1>
          <p>19 years has passed since the events of 9/11 and now that you know what happened during 9/11 and what happened even before the 9/11 plan came to fruision, it's now time to focus on our last subject. What did the U.S government do right after the 9/11 attacks, and what do we know and do today. </p>

          <h1 pl-3>The War on Terror</h1>
          <hr>
          <p>Al Qaeda caused numerous amounts of sadness, torment and most horrific of all, death. But this doesn’t mean America is coming out of this event unscathed. That’s right, even the United States of America used fear to vindicate unjust behavior on many countries in Asia. <br> <br></p>
          <p>The War on Terror started on the same day as 9/11, though it became known the day after when the Bush Foundation proclaimed to the entire world the start to the War on Terror. He declared at a joint congress about what had just transpired and announced that he was going to end the terrorists. He stated that "Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there. It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped, and defeated." On paper that sounds excellent. Stopping people who killed thousands of innocents should be rewarded. But the real problem was that he made no contrast between the terrorists and the countries that housed terrorists. He said that North Korea was developing “weapons of mass destruction” and ready to attack America with it, that Iran and Iraq supported terror, after that he reported that those countries made an “axis of evil”. He made it seem as if all of Iran and Iraq were terrorists, which is undoubtedly not true. Finally, he claimed that these were attacking America because “we love freedom” and “they hate freedom.” But, the definition of freedom is arbitrary, one person’s definition might be completely different from another person’s definition of freedom, on top of that definitions of words are not constant. But it seems that George W Bush wanted to do good. The idea of the War on Terror is positive. He had resolve and courage after the 9/11 attacks to stop terrorists, it was just that he didn’t carry his resolve out the best way he could.</p>

        <h1 pl-3>What We Now Know and Do Today</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The War on Terror was to a degree, pretty bad. It harmed innocents, it cost the United States of America 6 trillion dollars to fund, and ultimately it failed to even stop the terrorists. But that doesn't mean we didn't learn anything from 9/11 which we'll discuss in this section. <br> <br></p>
        <p>We now know that people from outside America dislike us. Before, terrorists like al Qaeda, ISIS, and other like-minded groups were taking the backseat of threats but now, we know that terrorism is a serious problem. We learned to be more secure on airplanes. Have you ever wondered why you can’t bring liquid or food to a plane? 9/11 is a big influence on why that happened, because one of the hijackers used a liquid bomb to hijack the plane. People learned from the War on Terror and now people are more reluctant to go on violent and expensive wars. The War on Terror also taught us another lesson, that instead of trying to silence terrorists, maybe instead we should target the ideology the terrorists follow- jihadism. So true, 9/11 was a terrible disaster but at least we learned many things like air plane safety, terroism and learning that there might be another to defeat terrorism than violence.</p>
