            <h1>8:46 AM The Attack On The WTC's North Tower </h1>
            <p>9/11/2001 8:46 am. The 1st attack happened at 8:46 am, imagine looking up at one of the most well-known buildings in America, the WTC's (World Trade Center) Twin Towers and suddenly, in the corner of your eye you see a plane out of control, the plane is on fire, spreading smoke into the air, where is it going? The Twin Towers... the plane travels like a meteor and in seconds the plane with a speed of 400mph crashes into the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Fire galore, smoke billows out of the now chipped building of the North Tower. This was the 1st attack of 9/11, yes this is what actually happened in the day of 9/11/2001. A one of many attacks on America.</p>

            <p>9/11/2001 9:03 am, 17 minutes has passed after the WTC’s North Tower has been chipped by a flaming blaze of a plane. A diagonal slice appears on the side of the tower and smoke spews out of it. Suddenly a 2nd hijacked plane crashes into WTC’s South Tower, hundreds of firefighters and police officers rush into the 2 buildings trying to save thousands of trapped people, unfortunately at 9:59 am, the South Tower’s structure gave out and the South Tower collapsed into itself immediately and at 10:28 am, the North Tower collapsed. This killed 343 firefighters and 60 police officers and thousands of trapped people inside the World Trade Center. But even after these 2 devastating attacks, the terrorists were not done yet.</p>

          <p>9/11/2001 9:40 am, 40 minutes have passed since the South Tower had been hit by the hijacked plane. This was before the South Tower collapsed but people were obviously still scared and in awe when they saw both buildings, the South Tower and the North Tower. Reporters like Aaron Brown kept the masses calm and made people less scared. But at 9:40 am, another hijacked plane took off. This plane was heading for the headquarters of the U.S.A, the Pentagon... and you know what happened next, the plane smashed into the Pentagon and it was almost desensitizing to see smoke and fire rise up from the Pentagon. But after all of these attacks. 125 Pentagon workers died but, there was one more hijacked plane, and it was suspected to be heading to the White House.</p>

          <p>9/11/2001 10:03 am, 23 minutes have passed since the Pentagon had been destroyed by another hijacked plane and another hijacked was heading to the white house. But when all seemed lost, when it seemed like the White House was going to be annihilated by the hijacked plane, the passengers of United Airlines Flight 93 found out that their plane had been hijacked with their cell phones. They decided that this was enough and so they fought the terrorists on the plane to sacrifice themselves and kill the terrorists so that more innocent Americans live. Their sacrifice was not in vain and the plane that was supposed to head to the White House had crashed into an empty field of Pennsylvania. Though there were still fire and smoke for the most part 9/11, the worst terrorist attack in U.S history had ended and though it was a day of chaos and torture, it also gave us the clearest example of what it means to be a hero.</p>
